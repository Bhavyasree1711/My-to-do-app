# My  Firebase Todo App

This is a multi-user todo application built with Firebase.

## How It Works

* **Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to a private account.
* **Firestore:** The app uses a secure Firestore database.
* **Security Rules:** Each user can only see and manage their own todos.
